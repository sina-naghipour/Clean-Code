# Chapter 1 : Clean Code


why should we learn to code? shitty idea in my opinion, ai models are doing a better job. most of the code is generated rather than written.

we have specifications, and ai models can generate code based on those. but this idea is wrong.

specifying requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them is programming, such a specification is code.

even humans can't understand vague feelings of other humans. how could computers do such a thing?

so there will always be code, there cannot be a computer that understands our vague needs and specifications.

### **code** is the language in which we ultimately express the requirements.

**code** will never be eliminated.

messy code makes the productivity of the code to asymptotically approach zero. after productivity decreases in order to increase it, management decides to recruit new members. **but that new member does not know the difference between a change that matches the design, or a change that tangles the design.**

eventually, bad code, leads to another team redesigning the current working but no so efficiently system, and this is not cost-friendly and this battle of to two teams competing to build a system can last forever.

### good code rots into bad code, rather quickly.


### Programming Conundrum

prorgammers face a conundrum of basic values, they all know bad code, slows them down. yet, still under the pressure of deadlines they feel the need of making a mess.

it's no good to write clean code without knowing what clean code is.
