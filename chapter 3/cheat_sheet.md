|  | functions should be `small`. |
|  | functions should only do `one` thing. |
|  | the indent level of a function should not be greater than 1 or 2. |
|  | blocks within `if`, `else`, `while` and so on should be 1 line long, that line should probably be a function call. |
|  | functions should do one thing. they should do it well. they should do it only. |
