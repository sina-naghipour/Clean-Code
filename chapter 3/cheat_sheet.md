| Chapter 3 | Note |
| --- | --- |
|  | functions should be `small`. |
|  | functions should only do `one` thing. |
|  | the indent level of a function should not be greater than 1 or 2. |
|  | blocks within `if`, `else`, `while` and so on should be 1 line long, that line should probably be a function call. |
|  | functions should do one thing. they should do it well. they should do it only. |
|  | a long descriptive name is better than a long descriptive comment. |
|  | `Flag arguments` are terrible. |
|  | two argument functions are okay if they follow a natural ordering like `point(x,y)`. |
|  | if some of arguments are treated identically, they are equivalent to a single argument of type `List`. |
|  | your function promised to do one thing, and it shouldn't hiddenly do other things. |
|  | Error handling is one thing |
|  | try/catch blocks mix error processing with normal processing. |
